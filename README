This README file contains information on building the meta-vcoreiii
BSP layer.

The source for this Yocto layer is:

  URI: git://github.com/vtss/meta-vtss-vcoreiii.git

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
  layers: meta meta-yocto meta-yocto-bsp (default poky layers)
  branch: dylan

The BSP has been tested on poky-dylan-9.0.3. Later Yocto releases will
probably work as well, but has this not been verified.

The BSP provide a 3.14.x Linux kernel (currently the latest kernel.org
longterm release), and include architecture support and platform
drivers for the MIPS 24KEc processor present in most of the VTSS
switching chipsets. Furthermore, UnionFS support has been merged to
provide a robust, writable root file system basing upon SquashFS and
JFFS2 on the avaiable board platforms.

Patches
=======

Please submit any patches against this BSP to the maintainer:

I. Building the meta-vcoreiii BSP layer
========================================

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website - or use
'git' to clone the poky repository.

Having done that, and assuming you extracted the BSP tarball contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a
vcoreiii image by adding the location of the meta-vcoreiii
layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  poky/meta-xxxx \
  poky/meta-vcoreiii \

To enable the vcoreiii layer, add the appropriate MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "luton10"
 or
  MACHINE ?= "luton26"
 or
  MACHINE ?= "jaguar1"
 or
  MACHINE ?= "jaguar2"
 or 
  MACHINE ?= "serval1"
 or 
  MACHINE ?= "serval2"

You should then be able to build a vcoreiii image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env build_<target>
  $ bitbake core-image-minimal

After this completes, you should find the images in
"tmp/deploy/images". There will be a "vmlinux-3.14.<machine>.gz"
(kernel) and a "core-image-minimal-<machine>.squashfs-xz" (root fs)
file.

Refer to the next section to learn how to install the images on the
target boards.

II. Booting the images
